# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
In this project, I applied the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I have pressed “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loop
Created a visual representation of data using pandas and matplotlib to construct a line graph and scatterplot to determine if the duration of Netflix movies (divided by genre) has increased from 2011 to 2020.
